# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WHEN I search for a city
- [x]THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- [x]WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- [ ]THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- [x] WHEN I view the UV index
- [x] THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- [x] WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- [x] THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- [x] WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- [x] THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
